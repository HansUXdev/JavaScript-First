# About
This project aims to use extensions to keep people connected and engaged in a remote learning environment.
This file is meant to be a place to document extensions for consideration.
The `.vscode/` is used primarily to recommend the approved extensions for local development, the `.gitpod.yml` is used to configure the remote environment as a whole (which can include the codium versions of these extensions).



# Extension Goals & Areas
