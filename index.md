### Live Streamed Classes

I'm currently using [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hansoncoding/about) as a way to deliver free live classes and go through the content of the book every week and collect feedback on it from viewers, but I don't know how sustainable this will be without [supporters](https://github.com/sponsors/HansUXdev).  

If the button below says I'm live, Click it.
