## For more content:
This book is still in **early access** and is designed to provide an **interactive experiance** through [GitPod](http://gitpod.io/), [Twitch ![Twitch Status](https://img.shields.io/twitch/status/hansoncoding?label=)](https://twitch.tv/hansoncoding), [codetogether](https://www.codetogether.com/), [gitduck](https://gitduck.com/) and other means of activities that facilitate remote learning.

I plan to use [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hansoncoding/about) as a way to go through the content of the book every week and collect feedback on it from viewer in fun, interactive ways.

The majority of the content in this repository is the refined version of the content found in [OSS Books](https://github.com/HansUXdev/OSS-Books) as begin to formalize everything for a legitimate chapter. I write my code snippets and notes and everything there before publishing it and bringing it over here.
