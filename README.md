# JavaScript First
By Brett "Hans" McMurdy

In this book, you'll learn how to code with JavaScript using the node.js runtime environment rather than a browser and by the end, you will build a server and a website using JavaScript.

-----

This book is still in **early access** and is designed to provide an **interactive reading experiance** through GitPod and [Twitch ![Twitch Status](https://img.shields.io/twitch/status/hansoncoding?label=)](https://twitch.tv/hansoncoding).

I plan to use [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hansoncoding/about) as a way to go through the content of the book every week and collect feedback on it from viewer in fun, interactive ways.

GitPod is used to provide my readers with a zero-config developer environment where they can follow along even on a chromebook or tablet.
